## Digital Signatures:
RSA is also used for digital signatures, where the sender signs a message with their private key.
Anyone with the sender's public key can verify the signature to ensure the message's authenticity and integrity.
RSA's security relies on the mathematical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, which is used in key generation. As long as factoring remains computationally infeasible for sufficiently large numbers, RSA remains a secure encryption and digital signature scheme.
